## üé® PHASE 3: AI-ASSISTED CONTENT GENERATION

### DELIVERABLE 1: Print Advertisement

#### **Iteration 1: Initial Concept Prompt**

```
Create a print advertisement for MoodWatch‚Ñ¢, an AI-powered emotional 
regulation assistant used in corporate wellness programs. 

PRODUCT DETAILS:
- Tracks employee emotional states through calendar integration, facial 
  recognition, and music listening patterns
- Generates "Emotional Efficiency Scores" for individuals and teams
- Provides manager dashboard with aggregate team insights
- Integrates with Spotify, Outlook, and existing HR systems

TARGET AUDIENCE:
HR Directors and Corporate Wellness Managers at mid-to-large tech companies

TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional and aspirational
- Frame surveillance as "support" and "insights"
- Similar to real HR tech products (like BetterUp or Culture Amp)
- Slightly unsettling on second read, but believable as real
- Balance "employee wellness" language with "management insights"

REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
- Compelling headline (question format preferred)
- 2-3 short paragraphs of body copy
- Clear value proposition for HR buyers
- Call-to-action directing to demo or consultation
- Professional but subtly dystopian undertones

VISUAL CONCEPT DESCRIPTION:
Suggest an image concept that shows a modern office environment with 
subtle emotional data visualization overlays. Should look like a real 
tech company advertisement.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide the full ad copy with visual concept notes.
```

#### **Iteration 2: Refinement Prompt**

```
Review the MoodWatch‚Ñ¢ print ad and refine with these adjustments:

STRENGTHEN:
- Make the headline more provocative - use a question that makes readers 
  slightly uncomfortable about current emotional blind spots
- Add one specific metric or statistic (you can make it up, but make it 
  sound plausible - like "73% of employee burnout is predictable 2 weeks 
  in advance")
- Include a subtle mention of manager dashboards without being too obvious

TONE ADJUSTMENT:
- Keep the professional veneer but add one sentence that could be read two 
  ways - either genuinely caring OR quietly invasive
- Make it sound MORE like a real LinkedIn ad for HR tech

ENSURE:
- Call-to-action is specific and actionable
- Benefit to the company (not just employee) is crystal clear
- Language uses wellness/wellbeing vocabulary, not monitoring vocabulary
```

accompany it. Include color palette suggestions that align with 
professional HR tech branding.
```

PLATFORM ADAPTATION:

## üéØ INSTRUCTOR NOTES: USING THIS AS A MODEL

### How to Demonstrate This to Students

1. **Live Code-Along Option:**
   - Walk through creating the GitHub issue in real-time
   - Demonstrate running ONE prompt (print ad iteration 1)
   - Show how to evaluate and create iteration 2 prompt
   - Let students complete the remaining deliverables

2. **Complete Example Option:**
   - Execute this entire plan yourself first
   - Create a "reference repository" students can view
   - Use as a comparison point (not a template to copy)
   - Emphasize: "This is ONE way to do it, not THE way"

3. **Partial Demo Option:**
   - Create the issue and branch structure
   - Show prompts but don't execute them
   - Let students discover what outputs look like
   - Use your completed version for review calibration

### Key Teaching Moments to Highlight

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Why specificity matters (compare generic vs. detailed prompts)
- How constraints improve outputs (character limits, tone guidance)
- The value of iteration (show how refining beats starting over)

**Git Workflow:**
- Why issues come before code (planning prevents chaos)
- Branch naming conventions (consistency = collaboration)
- Commit messages as documentation (future you will thank present you)

**Professional Skills:**
- Self-assessment honesty (gaming the rubric teaches nothing)
- Process documentation value (show your thinking, not just results)
- Team collaboration evidence (individual work ‚â† team project)

### Common Student Pitfalls to Address

1. **"The AI did it, so I'm done"**
   - Emphasize: AI is a tool, not a replacement for thinking
   - Iteration demonstrates understanding

2. **"My first attempt was good enough"**
   - Show side-by-side comparison of iteration 1 vs. final
   - Quantify improvement

3. **"I don't need to document my process"**
   - Explain: Process documentation proves you learned
   - It's evidence of skill development, not just output

4. **"Can I just copy the example?"**
   - "You can copy the STRUCTURE, not the CONTENT"
   - Different products require different approaches

### Assessment Calibration

Use this completed example to:
- **Calibrate scoring:** Run through rubric yourself
- **Identify edge cases:** What if they nail tone but miss CTA?
- **Set expectations:** Share score range you'd give this work
- **Create comparison:** "If this is a 27/30, what's a 21/30?"
