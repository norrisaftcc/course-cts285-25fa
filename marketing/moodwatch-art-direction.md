## üé≠ THE SATIRICAL VISUAL LAYER

### What Makes the Design Satirically Effective

**Subtle Dystopian Details:**
- Ceiling cameras barely visible in photos
- Data overlays that reveal surveillance on close inspection
- "Efficiency scores" that quantify the unquantifiable
- Clean aesthetics that hide invasive functionality

**Corporate Aesthetics Used Critically:**
- Professional design language that normalizes monitoring
- Wellness color palettes (green, blue) applied to surveillance
- Friendly, approachable UI for unsettling features
- Trademark symbols emphasizing proprietary control

**Visual Irony:**
- Smiling employees being quantified
- "Wellness" dashboard that tracks every emotion
- Privacy disclaimers in smallest legal text
- Aspirational lifestyle shots of constant monitoring

### Teaching Moment: Design Ethics

Students should recognize:
1. How visual design can normalize surveillance
2. How professional aesthetics create trust that may be misplaced
3. How UI/UX patterns guide users toward compliance
4. How color psychology manipulates emotional responses
5. How "good design" can serve questionable purposes

**The question designers should ask:**
*"Does making this look good make it more or less ethical?"*
