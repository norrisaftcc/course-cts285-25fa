# Flask Hi-Low Game

Goal here is to build a simple Flask app for educational and training purposes.

PRD is provided.

NOTES:
The program doesn't have gambling (no fake coins or tickets), but it does track win rate.
Appears to work correctly.

FEEDBACK:
Claude busted me for merging the PR before actually, yknow, testing it. Fair point, do that next time.
Other than that, he liked his own code, not too suprising.
